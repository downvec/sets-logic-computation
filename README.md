# phil379
# Sets, Logic, Computation

Textbook for Calgary's Logic II course based on the Open Logic
Project.  Covers naive set theory, first-order logic, sequent calculus
and natural deduction, the completeness, compactness, and
LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem theorems, Turing machines, and the undecidability of
the halting problem and of first-order logic.

This repository/directory only contains the LaTeX files and
illustrations needed to typeset the textbook _Sets, Logic,
Computation_, which in turn requires the _[Open Logic
Text](http://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/)_.

You can [download the
PDF](http://builds.openlogicproject.org/courses/phil379/phil379-screen.pdf)
from the [Open Logic builds
site](http://builds.openlogicproject.org/).

To install and compile:

- Download/install the _Open Logic Text_ from
  [GitHub](http://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/)
- Navigate to the subdirectory `courses/`
- Put the content of this repository into a subdirectory of it, say
  `courses/phil379`.

If you use `git`, this should do it:

- `# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic.git`
- `# cd OpenLogic/courses`
- `# git clone https://github.com/rzach/phil379.git`

Inside `courses/phil379`, you can now compile:

- `# cd phil379`
- `# pdflatex phil379-screen` or just `# make` if you have `latexmk`
  installed. (You'll also have to do `makeglossaries phil379-screen`
  to get the glossary, and `bibtex phil379-screen` for the
  bibliography.)

The file `phil379-screen.tex` produces a color version of the text
with smaller margins for screen reading. `phil379-print` produces a
black-and-white version designed for printing on Crown Quarto stock
(without cover). It can be used together with `cover-lulu-quarto.pdf`
on the print-on-demand website `lulu.com`. You can order a printed
copy [there](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/openlogicproject).

Both versions load `phil379.tex`, which contains the actual
material. It in turn includes other files, most of them from the
`OpenLogic` repository. So you won't get a complete book unless you
download into the right subdirectory of and compile from there.
